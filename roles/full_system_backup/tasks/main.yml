# TODO: If you plan on backing up your system somewhere other than /mnt or /media, do not forget to add it to the list of exclude patterns to avoid an infinite loop.

# TODO: If there are any bind mounts in the system, they should be excluded as well so that the bind mounted contents is copied only once.

# TODO: If you use a swap file, make sure to exclude it as well.
#If GVFS is installed, /home/*/.gvfs must be excluded to prevent rsync errors.
#If Dhcpcd â‰¥ 9.0.0 is installed, exclude the /var/lib/dhcpcd/* directory as it mounts several system directories as sub-directories there.
